## Usage

__NOTE__: Create a [GitHub token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) with `repo:status` and `public_repo` scopes

__NOTE__: The module accepts parameters as command-line arguments or as ENV variables (or any combination of command-line arguments and ENV vars).
Command-line arguments take precedence over ENV vars


| Command-line argument |  ENV var                 |  Description                                                                                                               |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| token                 | GITHUB_TOKEN             | Github access [token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)                      |
| owner                 | GITHUB_OWNER             | Github repository owner (_e.g._ `cloudposse`)                                                                              |
| repo                  | GITHUB_REPO              | Github repository name (_e.g._ `github-commenter`)                                                                         |
| type                  | GITHUB_COMMENT_TYPE      | Comment type: `commit`, `pr` or `issue`                                                                                    |
| sha                   | GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA        | Commit SHA. Required when `type=commit`                                                                                    |
| number                | GITHUB_PR_ISSUE_NUMBER   | Pull Request or Issue number. Required when `type=pr` or `type=issue`                                                      |
| format                | GITHUB_COMMENT_FORMAT    | Comment format (optional). Supports `Go` [templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template): `My comment:<br/>{{.}}`         |
| comment               | GITHUB_COMMENT           | Comment text. If neither `comment` nor `GITHUB_COMMENT` provided, will read from `stdin`                                   |


__NOTE__: The module accepts the text of the comment from the command-line argument `comment`, from the ENV variable `GITHUB_COMMENT`, or from the standard input.
Command-line argument takes precedence over ENV var, and ENV var takes precedence over standard input.
Accepting comments from `stdin` allows using Unix pipes to send the output from another program as the input to the module

```sh
    cat comment.txt | github-commenter ...
```

```sh
    terraform plan 2>&1 | github-commenter -format "Output from `terraform plan`<br/>```{{.}}```"
```




## Examples

The module can be called directly or as a Docker container.

### Build the Go program locally

```sh
go get

CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -v -o "./dist/bin/github-commenter" *.go
```

### Run locally with ENV vars
[run_locally_with_env_vars.sh](examples/run_locally_with_env_vars.sh)

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export GITHUB_OWNER=cloudposse
export GITHUB_REPO=github-commenter
export GITHUB_COMMENT_TYPE=pr
export GITHUB_PR_ISSUE_NUMBER=1
export GITHUB_COMMENT_FORMAT="My comment:<br/>{{.}}"
export GITHUB_COMMENT="+1 LGTM"

./dist/bin/github-commenter
```

### Run locally with command-line arguments
[run_locally_with_command_line_args.sh](examples/run_locally_with_command_line_args.sh)

```sh
./dist/bin/github-commenter \
        -token XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -owner cloudposse \
        -repo github-commenter \
        -type pr \
        -number 1 \
        -format "My comment:<br/>{{.}}" \
        -comment "+1 LGTM"
```

### Build the Docker image
__NOTE__: it will download all `Go` dependencies and then build the program inside the container (see [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile))


```sh
docker build --tag github-commenter  --no-cache=true .
```

### Run in a Docker container with ENV vars
[run_docker_with_env_vars.sh](examples/run_docker_with_env_vars.sh)

```sh
docker run -i --rm \
        -e GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -e GITHUB_OWNER=cloudposse \
        -e GITHUB_REPO=github-commenter \
        -e GITHUB_COMMENT_TYPE=pr \
        -e GITHUB_PR_ISSUE_NUMBER=1 \
        -e GITHUB_COMMENT_FORMAT="My comment:<br/>{{.}}" \
        -e GITHUB_COMMENT="+1 LGTM" \
        github-commenter
```

### Run with Docker
Run `github-commenter` in a Docker container with local ENV vars propagated into the container's environment.
[run_docker_with_local_env_vars.sh](examples/run_docker_with_local_env_vars.sh)

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export GITHUB_OWNER=cloudposse
export GITHUB_REPO=github-commenter
export GITHUB_COMMENT_TYPE=pr
export GITHUB_PR_ISSUE_NUMBER=1
export GITHUB_COMMENT_FORMAT="My comment:<br/>{{.}}"
export GITHUB_COMMENT="+1 LGTM"

docker run -i --rm \
        -e GITHUB_TOKEN \
        -e GITHUB_OWNER \
        -e GITHUB_REPO \
        -e GITHUB_COMMENT_TYPE \
        -e GITHUB_PR_ISSUE_NUMBER \
        -e GITHUB_COMMENT_FORMAT \
        -e GITHUB_COMMENT \
        github-commenter
```



### Run with Docker using Env File
Run the `github-commenter` in a Docker container with ENV vars declared in a file.
  [run_docker_with_env_vars_file.sh](examples/run_docker_with_env_vars_file.sh)

```sh
docker run -i --rm --env-file ./example.env github-commenter
```
